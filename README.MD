## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Cloudinary to host all images used online
- Font awesome to inpute ranges of icons used 


### What I learned
```html
giving a particular html element multiple classes, so as to tag each of them seperately to style them without having bulky codes and repeatitions

<h1>grid grid-3 text-center my-4"</h1>
```

```css
sectioning each classes from the html to a particular commented header so as to know where to edit or style when need be.

/* Text sizes */
.lead {
  font-size: 20px;
}

.sm {
  font-size: 1rem;
}

.md {
  font-size: 2rem;
}

.lg {
  font-size: 3rem;
}

.xl {
  font-size: 4rem;
}

.text-center {
  text-align: center;
}

The above code tells me to edit this particular section if i need to edit any text size 
```

### Continued development

Need to practice more on css grids, flex box positioning animations and media qurreys
